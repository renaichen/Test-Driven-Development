## The Test Driven Development (TDD)

Once upon a time, there is some famous saying from a lengedary programmer, 
*"there are only two types of developers in the universe, one test their code frequently, the other don't"*. 
Apparently the former is much more likely to develop products that stand the test of time, unless the latter is God Himself writing the code.

The concept of test driven development or TDD, was proposed by [Kent Beck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kent_Beck) 
in the late 20th and early 21st century. Basically, it encourages programmers to develop code with steps as: 
- Add a test
- Run all tests and see if the new one fails
- Write some code
- Run tests
- Refactor code
- Repeat (every circle, as few edits as possible)

Such principles may be implemented differently for different programming languages, 
but once they are embedded into developers daily development, combined with [*unit test*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing) toolkits of specific languages, 
the benefits can be enormous.

## Unit Test Modules for *Python*
As one of the most popular high-level object-oriented langauges, *Python* has many excellent unit testing modules. 
The most used ones are probably, `unittest`, `py.test`, `Nose`.
